I am basically working with index files and will be using b-trees to manage them. The project itself looks quite interesting, but given what my friends have been saying about it, I am a bit nervous. It looks like it will take quite some time, and I don't have too much to spare at the moment. I simply didn't have time to start this project until now, so my anxiety has started already. However, I bet that if I plan properly, take it one step at a time, and make sure I test frequently along the way, I'll be just fine. I think I need to look more into binary files and how to use them in Python, because that entire concept is very confusing to me. Soon, I will start my actual coding session.
