I am basically working with index files and will be using b-trees to manage them. The project itself looks quite interesting, but given what my friends have been saying about it, I am a bit nervous. It looks like it will take quite some time, and I don't have too much to spare at the moment. I simply didn't have time to start this project until now, so my anxiety has started already. However, I bet that if I plan properly, take it one step at a time, and make sure I test frequently along the way, I'll be just fine. I think I need to look more into binary files and how to use them in Python, because that entire concept is very confusing to me. Soon, I will start my actual coding session.

Like I had mentioned before, I think it is best if I do small portions each time so that I don't get overwhelmed. I think my goal for this session is to simple set up the menu of the program as well as the basic functions of creating, opening, and closing files. I'm not too worried about the formatting of the files at the moment, just getting them open and creating them. I am going to work on it pretty incrementally as I have other work to do, so it will probably take longer than it would take if I just sat down for a committed coding session.
