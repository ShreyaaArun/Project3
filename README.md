I was not able to complete this Project due to extenuating circumstances and some lack of proper time mangement. Therefore, my current code only has the most basic menu command functionalities. The B-Tree code has been placed from my homework code, but I have not actually made modifications to it and any attempts to incorporate it with my project code. The test.idx file need not to be worried about.
